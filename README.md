üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Methods
Language: Python

Core Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, nltk, joblib

Feature Engineering: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Vectorization

Model: Logistic Regression (Baseline Classification Model)

Deployment: Streamlit (Web Application)

üöÄ How to Run Locally
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed.

pip and venv (Virtual Environment).

Installation
Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]
cd sentiment-analyzer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Training & Deployment
Train the Model: Run the core script to train the Logistic Regression model on the synthetic data and save the model files (.joblib):

python sentiment_analysis.py

Launch the App: Start the Streamlit web application:

streamlit run app.py

The application will open in your browser, ready for testing.
